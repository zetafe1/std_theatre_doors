This is a simple edit for SaintDenis Theater Vaudeville interior doors + colision edition to have more space on the stage.

just drop this files inside any stream folder... 

For Roleplay: instead of going inside the room by some lateral doors you can get inside on the main room by the main doors.
Also removed from stage few props and colisions so there is more space on stage.
